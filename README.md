A deep market intelligence skill for AI agents. **Real investment work for real capital allocation** — thesis-driven, source-attributed, evidence-chain-based analysis that would withstand scrutiny from a portfolio manager, not a script dump with a clean-looking template.

**Always uses current date automatically** (`datetime.now()`) — never hallucinates dates. **Full yfinance access** — 26 scripts powered by free, no-API-key market data.

## What This Skill Does---

## Quick Start Example

Here's what the output looks like — decisive, structured, actionable:

```
## ANALYSIS: AAPL

### Thesis
AAPL is transitioning from hardware to services-led growth. The market underestimates the durability of Services margins (>70%) and overestimates iPhone cycle risk. At 28x forward earnings, it's not cheap but the compounding quality justifies it in this regime.

### What the Market Is Missing
Services revenue growing at 15%+ with 70%+ gross margins, now representing 25% of total revenue — the multiple should expand as this mix becomes visible.

### Key Evidence
- Services grew 14.2% YoY to $24.2B, with 74.6% gross margin (+240bps)
- iPhone revenue flat YoY but ASP up 5% — volume weakness offset by pricing power
- $110B buyback authorized — management signal of undervaluation
- Vision Pro just starting; enterprise adoption early but promising

### The Opposing Case
China competition is real (Huawei resurgence), iPhone upgrade cycle is the longest ever, and the AI integration story is behind Android competitors. Services growth will eventually decelerate as the installed base matures.

### What Would Change My Mind
China revenue down >15% YoY in two consecutive quarters, OR Services growth falls below 10% — either triggers downgrade to HOLD.

### Decision
- **VERDICT**: BUY
- **CONVICTION**: Medium (7/10)
- **TIME HORIZON**: 12-18 months
- **ENTRY**: $185 | **STOP**: $165 (-11%) | **TARGET**: $220 (+19%)
- **KEY RISK**: China regulatory/competitive pressure on hardware

### Scenario Probabilities
| Scenario | Probability | Target | Catalyst |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Bull | 25% | $240 (+30%) | AI hardware cycle, Services acceleration |
| Base | 55% | $220 (+19%) | Steady growth, multiple holds |
| Bear | 15% | $170 (-8%) | China weakness, margin compression |
| Black Swan | 5% | $140 (-24%) | Regulatory action, pandemic-style demand collapse |

Expected Value: +15.3%

### Monitoring Triggers
- Services growth <12% YoY → reassess
- China revenue down >10% → downgrade to HOLD
- Stock breaks below $165 → stop-loss triggers
```

**Every analysis follows this structure. Thesis first, then evidence, then decision.**

Most quant skills run scripts and average the signals. This one **thinks first**.

The agent forms a causal thesis about what drives an asset, researches what matters, self-verifies by building the opposing case, then uses quantitative tools to challenge or sharpen its view. Scripts are sanity checks and measurement tools — not substitutes for reasoning.

**Result**: Analysis that identifies the 2-4 variables that matter, explains the causal mechanism, states what would change its mind, and delivers a decisive BUY / SELL / HOLD / WAIT / PASS verdict with calibrated confidence.

---

## The Reasoning Loop

Every analysis follows this process:

1. **Orient** — What is this asset? What drives it? What regime is it in?
2. **Build thesis** — A specific, falsifiable causal claim (not a feeling)
3. **Identify unknowns** — The 2-4 things you need to know but don't
4. **Targeted research** — Find the decisive variable, not 10 articles saying the same thing
5. **Test with scripts** — Run the scripts relevant to YOUR thesis (not all of them)
6. **Red-team** — Steel-man the opposing case, find your weakest evidence
7. **Reconcile** — Does the opposing case change your thesis?
8. **Decide or pass** — BUY / SELL / HOLD / WAIT / PASS (passing is a valid answer)
9. **Set monitoring triggers** — What specific event would change your mind?

## What Makes This Different

| Traditional Quant Skill | Deep Market Analysis |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Run all scripts, average signals | Form thesis first, use scripts to test it |
| "RSI 70 = overbought" | "Earnings decelerating while multiples expand — the market is pricing in a re-acceleration that may not happen" |
| Cover every indicator | Identify the 2-4 variables that drive 80% of the outcome |
| List pros and cons, hedge | Steel-man the opposition, then take a position or pass |
| "Expected return: +14.73%" | "Likely +10-20% — range, not false precision" |
| "Consult a financial advisor" | Deliver conviction or say "no edge — pass" |
| Equities only | Equities, indices, commodities, FX, rates, crypto, special situations |

---

## Asset Coverage

Not just stocks. The skill adapts its framework across asset types:

- **Equities** — Earnings, moats, management, capital allocation
- **Indices / ETFs** — Concentration risk, breadth, factor rotation
- **Commodities** — Supply/demand, capital cycle, cost curves
- **FX** — Rate differentials, central bank policy, carry dynamics
- **Rates / Bonds** — Duration, credit, yield curve shape
- **Crypto** — Adoption, reflexivity, on-chain data, narrative
- **Special Situations** — M&A arb, spinoffs, restructuring, legal catalysts

Each asset type has a dedicated playbook with primary drivers, key questions, research priorities, and common pitfalls. See `references/asset_playbooks.md`.

## Scripts & Data (yfinance-Powered)

24 Python scripts providing free, no-API-key market data and analysis via **yfinance**:

### Core Scripts
| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `fetch_data.py` | 2+ years OHLCV via yfinance |
| `forecast.py` | Prophet forecast + RSI/MACD/Bollinger Bands |
| `backtest.py` | Strategy returns vs Buy & Hold (annualized alpha) |
| `risk_metrics.py` | Sharpe, Sortino, VaR, Beta, Max Drawdown |
| `master_analysis.py` | Aggregated signal synthesis (run last as cross-check) |

### Context Scripts

## Install

Copy-paste this prompt into **any AI agent** (OpenCode, kilo code, Codex, etc.) to install the skill:

```
Clone the edge-hunter skill from https://github.com/Timmy6942025/edge-hunter and set it up in my .agents directory so it works immediately.

Steps:
1. git clone https://github.com/Timmy6942025/edge-hunter.git ~/.agents/skills/edge-hunter
2. pip3 install --break-system-packages yfinance vectorbt prophet PyPortfolioOpt numpy pandas ruff
3. Confirm the skill is installed by checking if ~/.agents/skills/edge-hunter/SKILL.md exists.

Then tell me "Skill installed. Ready for deep market analysis."
```

**OpenCode users** can also run:
```bash
opencode install edge-hunter
```

---

## Update

When you make changes to the repo, users can update with one command:
```bash
# Option 1: Run the update script (easiest)
~/.agents/skills/edge-hunter/update-skill.sh

# Option 2: Direct git pull
cd ~/.agents/skills/edge-hunter && git pull

# Option 3: Re-install fresh (if issues)
git clone https://github.com/Timmy6942025/edge-hunter.git ~/.agents/skills/edge-hunter --force
```

---

## After Installation

Ask your agent:
```
Analyze AAPL stock and tell me if I should invest.
```

The agent will follow the reasoning loop: orient → build thesis → research → test with scripts → red-team → decide. You'll get a decisive BUY/SELL/HOLD/WAIT/PASS verdict with calibrated confidence, key evidence, the opposing case, and monitoring triggers. No disclaimers.

Or try a non-equity asset:
```
What's the outlook for gold (GLD) over the next 6 months?
```

```
Should I be in long-duration bonds (TLT) right now?
```

---

## Code Quality & CI

All scripts pass `ruff` linting and formatting with a security-focused configuration.

```bash
# Check for lint issues
cd ~/.agents/skills/edge-hunter && ruff check scripts/

# Auto-fix trivial lint issues
ruff check scripts/ --fix

# Check formatting (dry run)
ruff format --check scripts/

# Apply formatting
ruff format scripts/
```

A **CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`) runs `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, and `pytest` on every push and PR to `main`. All must pass before merging.
